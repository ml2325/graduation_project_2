# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce data to uncover insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and sales trends. The data is stored in an Excel file with multiple sheets, including customer information, transactions, genders, cities, branches, and merchants. The analysis is performed using Python, focusing on data cleaning, merging, and visualization.

---

## Project Structure
- **`E_commerce_project_2.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, merging, and visualization.
- **`E-commerce_data.xlsx`**: Excel file containing the e-commerce data.

---

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The data is loaded from the Excel file into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Merging**: Data from different sheets is merged into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values are handled, and unnecessary rows are dropped.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizations are created to analyze customer distribution by city and gender.

---

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

---

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Open the `E_commerce_project_2.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run the cells sequentially to load, clean, merge, and visualize the data.

## Insights
- **Customer Distribution by City**: A bar plot visualizes the top 10 cities by customer count.
- **Gender Distribution**: A pie chart shows the distribution of customers by gender.
-  **Coupon Usage:**: Insights into coupon transaction status (e.g., claimed vs. burnt coupons) over time .
-  **Customer Retention and Loyalty:**: Patterns in customer coupon usage frequency and
trends over time. .
-  **Heatmap:**: for city-wise or branch-wise coupon burn rates.
